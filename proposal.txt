Project Proposal & Collaboration Map

Overview:
By designing a CNN model we hope to accurately predict whether there is a respiratory infection present in anterior radiography images. Image classification models typically aim for an accuracy score above 90%, we want our model to align with industry standard. 

Tech Stack:
Model - Keras, TensorFlow
Database - MongoDB for image storage
Website - Javascript, CSS, HTML
Server- AWS 

Potential Expansion:
-multiple angle xrays
-multiple condition prediction (classes)
-other graphs based on general respiratory infections
-make the website multiples pages 
-models accuracy and loss printed with image
-allow user to play with the model 

Contributions:
Model - Everyone attempt to maximize
      - Analyze model results - Calvin
Database - Mckinley
Website - Kathryn + Jack
Server- Mckinley + everyone
      - Javascript Jack

Compare and finalize model by Sunday (Aug 4)
Spend the final week polishing website and stat visuals

Presentation:
Website styling 
Multiple pages
Interactivity
Graphs of accuracy vs epochs
Slide deck explaining process/model iterations
Animation??
