Project Proposal & Collaboration Map


Is anyone interested in learning R?
Do we want to build another website vs powerpoint?
Do we have a plan B if the model can't get over 75%?
If everything goes well, is there any type of expansion we want to consider?
What are we all excited to contribute?
Any notes on structuring files for this project?
